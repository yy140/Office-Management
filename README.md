* Hints on stretch functionality to implement:
* The text sending functionality should be implemented using [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api). You'll need to register for it. It’s free.
* Use the `twilio-ruby` gem to access the API
* Use the `Gemfile` to manage your gems
* Try and make use of mocks and/or stubs so that actual texts don't get sent when your tests are run
* However, if your code is loaded into IRB the text should actually be sent
* Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

> :warning: **WARNING:** think twice before you push your **mobile number** or **Twilio API Key** to a public space like GitHub :eyes:
>
> :key: Now is a great time to think about security and how you can keep your private information secret. You might want to explore environment variables.

### Code Review
In code review we'll be hoping to see:

  * All tests passing
  * High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
  * The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.
  * Commits are regular and scoped
